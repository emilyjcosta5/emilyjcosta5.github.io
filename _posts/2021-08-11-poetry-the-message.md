#### Who crafts this blameless chest?
#### Perfection is now charred-
#### For olive tree deemed blessed,
#### let its lumber be marred.
#### A dead man beat the nails
#### in the chaste olive wood.
#### This depraved man cries, ails,
#### building not one thing good.
#### Behold! The chest’s a tomb,
#### where God bids “lay down thy soul”.
#### Hark! The casket’s a womb,
#### where man reborn is made whole.
#### Who wakes this holy chest?
#### O! His Greatness manifest!
<br/>
#### Death henceforth suffers arrest.
#### His crafted now and ever rest.
