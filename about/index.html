<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p> In 2017, I graduated high school after only 3 years in school. I had no idea what to do after high school. I had not applied to any universities as my early graduation was unexpected. My grades were expectional but my drive was low. Frankly speaking, I was a rebelious kid and big-time trouble maker. I had so many absences on my report cards that it was shocking they let me graduate- let alone graduate early.</p>
<p> That summer I visited my family in Beirut, Lebanon to attend my cousin's wedding. Seeing how lost I was, my uncle and aunt invited me to move across the world from the U.S.A to Lebanon. My aunt ran Safe Haven, a girl's home which fostered girls from ages 3 to 17 while providing them education and TLC. Many of the girls are Palestinian and Syrian refugees or impoverished Lebanese. Safe Haven took space in the church building, Ras Beirut Baptist Church, that my grandfather built in the 1960s.</p>
